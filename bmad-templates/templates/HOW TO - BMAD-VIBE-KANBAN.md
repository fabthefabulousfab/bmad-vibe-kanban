## Your Selected Workflow

The workflow stories have been imported into Vibe Kanban. Below is a complete reference for each workflow type and what each story represents.

---

## Workflow Types

### 1. WORKFLOW_COMPLET (New Project / Complex Feature)

Full BMAD methodology for new projects or significant features requiring architectural planning.

**When to use:**
- Starting a brand new project from scratch
- Adding a complex feature requiring architecture changes
- Multi-module or multi-team projects

**Phases:**
```
Phase 1: Analysis     -> Brainstorm, Research, Product Brief
Phase 2: Planning     -> PRD, UX Design
Phase 3: Solutioning  -> Architecture, Test Design, NFR, Epics/Stories
Sprint 0: Setup       -> Test Framework, CI Pipeline
Phase 4: Implementation -> Story Loop (ATDD -> Dev -> Review -> Trace)
Phase 5: Release      -> Traceability Gate, Deploy
```

---

### 2. DOCUMENT_PROJECT (Existing Codebase Without Documentation)

Retroactively generate BMAD documentation for an existing project.

**When to use:**
- Existing project with working code but no documentation
- Legacy codebase that needs documentation before adding features
- Brownfield project onboarding

**Phases:**
```
Phase 0: Analysis     -> Analyze Codebase, Import Docs, Reconcile
Phase 2: Planning     -> PRD from Code
Phase 3: Solutioning  -> Architecture, Test Design, NFR
(Then follows standard workflow)
```

---

### 3. QUICK_FLOW (Simple Feature)

Accelerated workflow for small, well-defined features (1-3 stories max).

**When to use:**
- Simple feature that doesn't require architecture changes
- 1-3 stories maximum
- Test framework already in place
- CI/CD already configured

**Prerequisites:**
- `docs/architecture.md` exists
- `docs/prd.md` or equivalent exists
- `tests/` framework configured
- CI pipeline in place

**Phases:**
```
Quick Spec         -> Quick specification + Regression analysis
Story Loop         -> ATDD -> Dev -> Review -> Trace (per story)
Completion         -> Integration test, Merge
```

---

### 4. DEBUG (Bug Fix)

Structured diagnostic-fix-regression workflow for bug corrections.

**When to use:**
- Identified bug in production or testing
- Quick correction needed
- Restoring existing behavior (not new functionality)

**Phases:**
```
Diagnostic         -> Bug report, Analysis, Related tests
Correction         -> Write bug test (RED), Fix (GREEN), Verify
Non-Regression     -> Related tests, Module tests, Integration tests
Finalization       -> Update test suite, Document, Code review, Merge
```

## Story Loop (Chain of Verification)

For each development story, follow this chain:

```
1. ATDD (tea -> atdd)          -> Write tests that FAIL (RED)
2. Development (dev-story)     -> Implement until tests PASS (GREEN)
3. Test Review (tea -> review) -> Score >= 80/100
4. Code Review                 -> PR approved
5. Trace (tea -> trace)        -> Update traceability matrix
```

---

## End of Epic Steps

When completing an epic, execute these additional steps:

```
1. Automate (tea -> automate)  -> Fill coverage gaps
2. NFR Assess (tea -> nfr)     -> Validate NFRs (PASS/WAIVED)
3. Retrospective               -> Lessons learned
```

## Quick Reference

### Open Vibe Kanban
```
http://localhost:3001
```

### Re-run Import (UI Method)

**Note:** Import is now done via Vibe Kanban UI instead of CLI script.

1. Open Vibe Kanban: http://localhost:3001
2. Create or select your project
3. Click the orange **"+"** button in the "To Do" column
4. Select workflow scenario:
   - `workflow-complet` - New project from scratch
   - `document-project` - Document existing project
   - `quick-flow` - Simple feature addition
5. Click **"Execute"** to import all stories

**Legacy CLI method (deprecated):**
```bash
./scripts/import-bmad-workflow.sh --clean  # Still works but UI is preferred
```
